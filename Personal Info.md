My name is Vasile Vlad. I'm 26 years old and I am eager to change my life to my true passion : programming.

Education:
Theoretical Highschool "M. Eminescu" Barlad
 -  Profile: Mathematics/Informatics (C++ background)
 
Technical University "GH. Asachi" Iasi
 -  Faculty of Electrical Engineering
 -  Master's Degree in Power Engineering
 
I speak C1 level English and B1 level Italian.

I consider myself a rational thinking person, with a great curiosity of searching the easiest ways to solve problems. I have worked in the engineering industry as Design Engineer for the last 3 years, but I was never satisfied with myself. Java is the programming language that I think is best suited for myself and I want learn all its potential.
